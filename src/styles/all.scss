// =============================================================================
// UI-React Complete SCSS Entry Point
// =============================================================================
// This file imports all styles from @kibalabs/ui-react including base styles
// and all component styles. Use this when you want to import everything via
// SCSS and customize with your own overrides.
//
// Usage in consuming apps:
//   @use '@kibalabs/ui-react/styles/all';
//   // Then add your theme overrides...
//
// This eliminates the need to separately import dist/index.css

// Base styles (reset includes layer order declaration)
@use 'reset';
@use 'defaults';
@use 'global';
