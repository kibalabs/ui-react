# Theming Goals

The primary goals for theming in UI-React is to ensure ease of use, consistency and compounding.

## Ease of use

UI-React is intended to be plug and play. This means a user should be able to install UI-React and use its components immediately without any configuration or other work. The goal is to minimise the time to value.

This does not, however, mean the user cannot configure anything. UI-React is intended to allow a huge amount of customization so that each use of it could look totally different. This can be seen more in the theming sections of each component below.

## Consistency

Theming in UI-React should prevent a user from creating "random" looking particles without it being obvious in a pull request. In our workflow at Kiba Labs, we ask users to post a screenshot of their work whenever working on projects with an interface - it's often hard to tell what the output will look like from just the code.

To alleviate this a little (not entirely!), UI-React tries to ensure that each use of its particles look and feel as they do in other uses - which means that if I create a `<Button />` on two separate pages, they look and work in the same way. Following from this, if I use a `<ButtonGroup />` (which internally creates `<Button />`s), it looks and feels the same too. This includes when the particle is clicked on, hovered on, selected or unselected, and if its enabled or disabled.

The key part of this is that the components in UI-React always take the theme from the nearest `ThemeProvider`. UI-React doesn't allow colors, sizes or any stylistic preferences to be specified on the particle themselves.

Themes are defined to allow each component to look different in different **"variants"**. So, if the default checkbox on the page is a white on a black box, and somebody asks for a checkbox that is a black tick on a white box, we need to create a new "variant" which can then be used as `<Checkbox variant="black-on-white" />`. The key part of this is that with the structure of UI-React, the variant is created independently of this particular use case, which means it can be used anywhere in the application. This ensures that nothing is created with a "one-off" mentality - everything that is created is intended to be re-used.

With all that said, it's important that a user can override everything if they really want to. We enable this by allowing a theme to be passed in to most particles directly in the case where a totally custom theme is wanted.

## Compounding

Compounding refers to the idea of building on top of something that already exists. This builds on the general premise of atomic design (see Structure below) but extends it to the code level.

To see this, let's continue the example above with Checkboxs, and suppose they have a "box" area and a "text" area. There are multiple "states" the box could be in: selected and pressed on, selected and hovered on, selected and not interacted with, disabled and pressed on, etc etc. If we had to specify all the details for the text and box design for each of these states, the theme would be absurdly long. However, we do want to be able to create different design states at each level so we need a way to do this. Compounding here allows us to define a "base" design state and then define each of the individual states as a set of changes from the base - we will see more of this in the Defining a Theme section below.
