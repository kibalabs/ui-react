# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Kiba Labs' UI-React (yes, we need a better name ðŸ™„)

This is a React component library designed to exlpicitly separate that **theming**, **layout** and **structure** of your applications. This practice allows efficient, beautiful, consistent UIs to be built quickly by teams of all sizes.

## A quick example

To show you a whole bunch of concepts used in UI-React, here's an example "page" built just with UI-React:

<Canvas>
  <Story name='Quick Example'>
    <div> TODO(krishan711): think of a good example that demonstrates the principles we like </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## A bit of history

The first version of this library was built whilst I ([krishan711](https://twitter.com/krishan711)) worked with my awesome colleagues at Arkera, where we built incredible products for trading desks at banks and hedge funds. We had a small team working on lots of different things (over 250 independent services), so we had to find a way to build beautiful front-ends for our products very quickly, and so Pixel (internal and closed sourced) was born.

UI-React is my attempt to make the design decisions that allowed us to work with very high efficiency available to the wider world.

## Built with UI-React

### [everypage](https://www.everypagehq.com)

everypage is a website (landing page) builder which is actually just a thin, application-specific layer on top of UI-React. If you want to build a landing page just with JSON, check it out!

### [Appage](https://www.appage.io)

Appage is a small app built on top of everypage (we like stacking applications apparently). It lets you build a landing page for your app in minutes!
